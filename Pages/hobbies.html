                        <p>"The Last Stand" by Sabaton is a power metal anthem inspired by the historic 1897 Battle of Shiroyama. <br>

                            express myself and escape into my own world of creativity. Over the years, I've spent countless hours in my free time,<br>
                            pencil in hand, perfecting my technique and exploring different styles. Drawing has not only been a source of joy<br>
                            but also a therapeutic activity that helps me unwind and reflect. It’s a passion that continues to grow with each sketch,<br>
                            enriching my life and offering a fulfilling way to capture the beauty I see in the world.</p>
